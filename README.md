## What's Next?
The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:
- Look for a job as a developer!
- Join a local developer meetup (e.g. via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)).
- Check out the [readings](extras/readings.md) for classic books you can read that will expand your knowledge.
- Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of software development.
    - Explore the **actor model** through [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), a new functional programming language for the web based on the battle-tested Erlang Virtual Machine!
